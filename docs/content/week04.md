## Intro

This week we start looking into Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNN). We will work with Keras and/or ML5js. Example with Wekinators and tfjs can be provided during next week session. 


## Resources

+ [CNN - Intro from ML is Fun](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-3-deep-learning-and-convolutional-neural-networks-f40359318721)
+ [CNN - An Intuitive Explanation of Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/)
+ CNN - DL with Python - Chapter 5 (please refer to the link shared on Slack)


## Weekly task

### In Class

Read the articles above in [resources](#resources), and complete the 4 notebooks for week 04 in `ba_218_comppx_h1901/samples/notebooks`:

```
...
├── week04-05-introduction-to-convnets.ipynb
├── week04-06-using-convnets-with-small-datasets.ipynb
├── week04-07-using-a-pretrained-convnet.ipynb
└── week04-08-visualizing-what-convnets-learn.ipynb
```

Those notebooks are taken from the book _Deep Learning with Python_, (please refer to the link shared on Slack). You should be able to run most of the examples with your local instances of TF / Keras running on the CPU. At the meantime I will try to setup some machine on [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com) so that you can use their GPU for training :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: I'll share the link with you on Slack if / when this is done.

Convnets are a cornerstone of Deeplearning and you are going to learn a few very useful techniques this week. Namely: _'data augmentation'_ and _'feature extraction'_ for _'transfer learning'_ . 

### Assignment

For _developers_ your assignment is to use a CNN to build a classifier of your choice (either trained from scratch or using a pre-trained model). You can follow the techniques detailed in the notebooks. You will find some examples of datasets in the section [going further/tools](#tools) on this page. For those of you who worked with the shape classifier with the toy NN it might be interesting to try to use CNN as a comparison (see the Kaggle dataset in [tools](#tools)). 

Both _designers_ and _developers_ should start looking a bit more in details into their personal project (that we will start to work on after week 06) Which means:

1. Make some research (models architecture, datasets, tutorials, blog posts, etc...), please __share__ your finding on Slack if you think they could help some teammates.
2. For _designers_ you should start sketching some ideas either in the form of prototypes (high or low level), UI sketches, or even code experiment (P5, ML5).

By __next week__ (week 05) you should:

1. Have a __solid understanding__ of  Keras _(developers)_
2. Be able to __train / retrain__ your own __CNN__ with Keras _(developers)_
