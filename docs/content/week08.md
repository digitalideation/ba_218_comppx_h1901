## Intro

This week we will continue exploring generative models by discussing techniques used in DeepDream, Style Transfer, VAE and GAN.


## Resources

+ [GAN - Pix2Pix](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/)
+ [GAN - Style Transfer](https://blog.paperspace.com/art-with-neural-networks/)
+ [GAN - Face Swap](https://blog.paperspace.com/style-transfer-part-2/)
+ [Style Transfer - Neural Style](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style)


## Weekly task

Run and discuss the notebooks in `ba_218_comppx_h1901/samples/notebooks`. We will do that part in class most likely.
