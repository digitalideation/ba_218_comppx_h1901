## Intro

This week we are going to look into the inner working of a Neural Network. As a starter we will go through the different steps involved while training a NN. Then we will play together with a 'toy' version of a NN built by [Daniel Shiffman](http://thecodingtrain.com)

## Weekly task

Experiment with the toy NN:
+ Create a shape detector
+ Make the shape detector work with your webcam
+ Visualise the training process
+ Build a classification model using different datasets (try [mnist fashion](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist))
+ Try to do some of the above or to replicate the examples provided with ToyNN using another [tool](../#tools) and compare the performances
+ [More ideas](https://github.com/shiffman/NOC-S18/wiki/Homework-6) :new:
